Current bugs:
Screen flickering when quitting the game after playing a few levels.
 
Things that didn't work out but should be implemented:
Search/sort through maps for coins:
	Search/sort algorithm that shell sorts through each map and determines how many coins there are at the beginning (ex: variable map1_coins). 
	As the player collects coins, the map is updated and the new amount of coins is recorded (ex: variable updated_map1_coins). 
	When colliding with the nextLevel block, the two values are compared, and if updated_map1_coins = 0, the player can move onto the next level. Otherwise, game over. 

Water block:
	Player speed slows down when walking on water.
